## WARNING:
If you are stumbling onto this project, it isn't anything functional yet and should not be used by any person for any reason whatsoever. We aren't captains of legalese so suffice it to say you SHOULD NOT use this software.

## Git Workflow
Since you are added as a collaborator, you can push directly to this repository. That, however, is not recommended. Instead, we will use Pull Requests so we can review code and have the extra protection from "oops" moments.

## Installation
Simply ```git clone``` the repository.
